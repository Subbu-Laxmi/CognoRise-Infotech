Getting Started
Prerequisites:
Python 3.x installed on your system.

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/subbu-laxmi/CognoRise-Infotech


Task 1 - Calculator App üßÆ

About the Project
The Calculator App is a Python-based application that performs basic arithmetic operations in a simple and user-friendly interface. It is designed to handle common mathematical functions such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. With its intuitive layout and responsive buttons, this app is an excellent example of Python's capabilities in creating practical desktop tools.

Features
Basic Arithmetic Operations: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Clear Button: Easily reset the input fields for new calculations.
Graphical Interface: Built using Python‚Äôs Tkinter library for an intuitive user experience.
Responsive Design: Smooth and efficient interaction with buttons and input fields.

Built With:
Python: For implementing the calculator logic.
Tkinter: For building the graphical user interface.

This tool ensures better security by generating unpredictable passwords for online accounts or sensitive data.

Features
Custom Length: Specify the desired length of the password.
Character Options: Include or exclude uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
Randomized Output: Generates completely random and secure passwords every time.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive design using Python‚Äôs Tkinter library.

Built With
Python: For core functionality.
Tkinter: For building the graphical user interface.
random: To generate random characters.
