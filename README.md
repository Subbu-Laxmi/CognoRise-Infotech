# CognoRise-Infotech

Hello everyone, and welcome to this demo of my Python project, a simple calculator application. This project is part of my Python Development internship, conducted by Cognorise Infotech, which spans one month. The objective of this internship is to enhance my Python programming skills by working on various practical tasks.

Today, I'll demonstrate the calculator application I developed. It showcases essential programming concepts and GUI development using the Tkinter library. This calculator is designed to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Let me show you how it works.

Launching the Application: "When I run the program, a calculator window appears on the screen. The interface is designed to be simple and intuitive, making it easy to use."

Explaining the Interface: "At the top, there's a display area where numbers and results are shown. Below that, we have buttons for digits 0 to 9 and arithmetic operators like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. There's also a clear button to reset the input and an equal button to calculate the result."

Performing a Calculation: "Letâ€™s perform a simple calculation. I'll input the numbers '8' and '5', press the addition button, and then the equal button. As you can see, the result, '13', is displayed on the screen."

Demonstrating Another Operation: "Now, I'll show another example. I'll input '20', press the division button, then '4', and finally the equal button. The result, '5', is displayed correctly."

Error Handling : "The program is also designed to handle errors, such as dividing by zero. If I try to divide a number by zero, the calculator shows an appropriate error message instead of crashing."
