# CognoRise-Infotech

Hello everyone, and welcome to this demo of my Python projects. This projects are part of my Python Development internship, conducted by Cognorise Infotech, which spans one month. The objective of this internship is to enhance my Python programming skills by working on various practical tasks.

Task 1 - Calculator App üßÆ

About the Project
The Calculator App is a Python-based application that performs basic arithmetic operations in a simple and user-friendly interface. It is designed to handle common mathematical functions such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. With its intuitive layout and responsive buttons, this app is an excellent example of Python's capabilities in creating practical desktop tools.

Features
Basic Arithmetic Operations: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Clear Button: Easily reset the input fields for new calculations.
Graphical Interface: Built using Python‚Äôs Tkinter library for an intuitive user experience.
Responsive Design: Smooth and efficient interaction with buttons and input fields.

Built With:
Python: For implementing the calculator logic.
Tkinter: For building the graphical user interface.

Performing a Calculation: Let‚Äôs perform a simple calculation. I'll input the numbers '8' and '9', press the addition button, and then the equal button. As you can see, the result, '17', is displayed on the screen.

Demonstrating Another Operation: Now, I'll show another example. I'll input '20', press the division button, then '4', and finally the equal button. The result, '5.0', is displayed correctly.

Error Handling : The program is also designed to handle errors, such as dividing by zero. If I try to divide a number by zero, the calculator shows an appropriate error message instead of crashing.

This calculator application is a practical demonstration of how Python can be used to create interactive desktop tools with Tkinter. 

Task 2 : Password Generator üîê

About the Project
The Password Generator is a Python application designed to help users create strong, secure, and random passwords. It offers customization options to tailor the password's length and complexity based on the user's requirements. This tool ensures better security by generating unpredictable passwords for online accounts or sensitive data.

Features
Custom Length: Specify the desired length of the password.
Character Options: Include or exclude uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
Randomized Output: Generates completely random and secure passwords every time.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive design using Python‚Äôs Tkinter library.

Built With
Python: For core functionality.
Tkinter: For building the graphical user interface.
random: To generate random characters.
